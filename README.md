This file contains mechanical datasets used in the paper " Fault Diagnosis Method for Rotating Machinery Based on Diversified Kernel Multi-branch CNN ". Among them, the bearing dataset is the cited datasets, and the gearbox dataset is the dataset collected by the author.
Bearing dataset is from Case Western Reserve University bearing data center (http://csegroups.case.edu/bearingdatacenter/pages/welcome-case-western-reserve-university-bearing-data-center-website). Data used in the paper comes from drive end, which is marked as ‘DE’ in the data files.
Gearbox data is from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China, and the data is collected from Gearbox Dynamics Simulator of Spectra Quest. The dataset contains two sub-data sets, including bearing dataset and gear dataset.
For the data file name, take ‘miss_1600_80’ as an example, the first word represents the type of fault (miss), ‘_’ is used as the separator, the second number represents the speed (1600r/min), and the third number represent the load (80LB.IN.).
There are 6 columns of data in each data file of gear dataset. 1, 2, 3-the vibration data of the gearbox in the X, Y, and Z directions on the motor side. 4, 5, 6-the vibration data of the gearbox in the X, Y, and Z directions on the load side.
There are 3 columns of data in each data file of bearing dataset. 1, 2, 3-the vibration data of the gearbox in the X, Y, and Z directions on the load side.
